# MCQ Generator using Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) generator
developed as a learning project to understand Python packaging, modular code design,
and basic text processing techniques.

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to explore:
- How to structure a Python project using a `src/` layout
- Creating reusable modules
- Managing dependencies using `requirements.txt`
- Packaging a Python application using `setup.py`

## Project Structure
src/ # Core source code
experiment/ # Experimental and testing scripts
setup.py # Package configuration
requirements.txt # Project dependencies

## Functionality (High-level)
- Processes textual input
- Applies rule-based logic to generate question–answer pairs
- Formats output as multiple-choice questions

> Note: This project focuses on structural and logical understanding rather than
a production-ready MCQ generation system.

## Limitations
- Rule-based logic only
- No advanced NLP or transformer-based models
- Limited evaluation

## Learnings
- Python package structuring
- Dependency management
- Writing modular and reusable code
- Initial exposure to NLP-style problems

## Future Improvements
- Integrate NLP libraries (spaCy / NLTK)
- Add transformer-based question generation
- Improve distractor generation logic
- Add tests and documentation

## Disclaimer
This repository represents an early learning-stage project and is shared for
educational and documentation purposes.
